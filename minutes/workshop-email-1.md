# Workshop email 1

Dear colleagues,

we are organising a week-long workshop on open-source Python codes for gamma-ray astronomy:

  Python for gamma-ray astronomy
  MPIK, Heidelberg, Germany
  16-20th November 2015
  http://gammapy.github.io/PyGamma15/ 

The goals of this workshop are:
-  to share information about existing open-source Python packages relevant for gamma-ray astronomy (e.g. Astropy, Sherpa, Gammapy, naima, 3ML, FermiPy, ctapipe, GammaLib/ctools)
- to improve their capabilities and interoperability
- to provide training in using and contributing to these packages.

The focus will be mostly on high-level science tools and methods (gamma-ray source spectrum and morphology analysis and modeling, multi-mission analysis), but there will be a group of people working on lower-level analysis (data calibration, event reconstruction) as well.

Note that this workshop is not a Python 'boot camp' or ‘school’. We expect participants to have already used Python for at least some of their projects, even if only at a beginner level, and to have an interest to contribute to open-source projects.

If you’re interested, please go to http://gammapy.github.io/PyGamma15/ and read over the more detailed information on the workshop.

To register, please fill out the registration form before November 1st.

Please forward this email to anyone who may be interested!

Best regards,
