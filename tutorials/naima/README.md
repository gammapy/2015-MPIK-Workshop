# Tutorial - SED modeling with Naima

* Presenter: [Victor Zabalza](https://github.com/zblz)
* Duration: 90 min
* Time: Thursday, 11:00 - 12:30
* Location: Central seminar room

## Abstract

During this tutorial we will carry out the analysis of one or two non-thermal
sources and infer the particle distribution and environment parameters from
their spectra.

## How to prepare

* Go over the slides from the [SED modeling with Naima talk](https://github.com/gammapy/PyGamma15/tree/gh-pages/talks/naima) from Monday.

* Install naima following the instructions [in the naima
  docs](http://naima.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html).

* TODO: add a link to an example run to check that everything is installed
  correctly.

## Agenda


* Introduce the astrophysical sources to be analysed.
* Overview of the tools available in naima.
* First analysis with the interactive fitter.
* Prepare and execute an MCMC run.
* Analyse the results of the run
* How to report the results and astrophysical implication.

## Going further

TODO: give some suggestions / links what participants can do
after the tutorial to learn more ...
