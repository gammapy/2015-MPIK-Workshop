# Tutorial - Fermi-LAT data analysis

* Presenter: Matthew Wood and Jeremy Perkins
* Duration: 75 min
* Time: Wednesday, 9:15 - 10:30
* Location: Central seminar room

## Abstract

This tutorial teaches you to run Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data analyses
via the [Fermi ScienceTools](http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/)
and [FermiPy](https://github.com/fermiPy/fermipy).

TODO: does it make sense to also cover some other Python wrapper
(see http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/user/) or does
FermiPy provide all the functionality people usually want?

## How to prepare

Full set of installation instructions are [here](https://github.com/fermiPy/fermipy/blob/master/notebooks/Installation.ipynb).

These instructions describe how to do the following:

- Install Science Tools v10-00-05 (latest FSSC version compatible with Pass 8 data).
- Install pip.
- Install fermipy and its python dependencies.

Note that the Fermi STs can only be used with the python installation that comes packaged with the STs.  

## Agenda

- Review some basic aspects of the fermipy package (configuration management, etc.).
- Run a basic analysis of PG1553.  
- Cover some more advanced analysis examples: spatial extension fitting and bin-by-bin likelihoods.

## Going further

TODO: give some suggestions / links what participants can do
after the tutorial to learn more ...
