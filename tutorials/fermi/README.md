# Tutorial - Fermi-LAT data analysis

* Presenter: Matthew Wood and Jeremy Perkins
* Duration: 75 min
* Time: Wednesday, 9:15 - 10:30
* Location: Central seminar room

## Abstract

This tutorial teaches you to run Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data analyses
via the [Fermi ScienceTools](http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/)
and [FermiPy](https://github.com/fermiPy/fermipy).

## How to prepare

Full set of installation instructions are [here](https://github.com/fermiPy/fermipy/blob/master/notebooks/Installation.ipynb).

These instructions describe how to do the following:

- Install Science Tools v10-00-05 (latest FSSC version compatible with Pass 8 data).
- Install pip.
- Install fermipy and its python dependencies.

Note that the fermipy and the Fermi STs can only be used with the
python installation that comes packaged with the STs.

If you have fermipy and the STs installed you should be able to run
the notebooks in the tutorial directory by launching an ipython
notebook session.

## Agenda

- Review some basic aspects of the fermipy package (configuration management, etc.).
- Run a basic analysis of PG1553.  
- Cover some more advanced analysis examples: spatial extension fitting and bin-by-bin likelihoods.

## Going further

Additional documentation on running LAT analysis is available in the
[FSSC pages](http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/).
