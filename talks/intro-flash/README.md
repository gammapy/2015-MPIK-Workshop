# Flash introductions

* Chair: [Peter Eger](https://github.com/peger089)
* Duration: 40 min

## Abstract

Every participant introduces themselves in 1 min max.

Since we want to make sure everyone has a chance to introduce themselves at the
workshop, we will have a session on the first day where everyone will have up to
one minute to say a few words about themselves (you donâ€™t have to use up the
minute, but the one minute limit will be strictly enforced!). So have a think
about how you would like to introduce yourself to other participants!

For example:

* Where do you work? What do you work on?
* How did you get introduced to Python? What's your Python experience?
* What are your hopes for the workshop?
