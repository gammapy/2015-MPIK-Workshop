# Talk - GAMERA

## Abstract

GAMERA is a new open-source C++ package which handles the spectral modelling of non-thermally emitting astrophysical sources in a simple and modular way. It allows the user to devise time-dependent models of leptonic and hadronic particle populations in a general astrophysical context (including SNRs, PWNs and AGNs) and to compute their subsequent photon emission. Moreover, this package also contains the necessary tools to create Monte-Carlo population synthesis models.
It has been wrapped to a python package, GAPPA, which makes GAMERA now accessible to python users.
