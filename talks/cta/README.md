# Talk - CTA DATA overview

* Presenter: Catherine Boisson
* Duration: 15 + 5 min

## Abstract

The [Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)](www.cta-observatory.org) is the
next-generation observatory for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy.

This presentation will give an overview of the activities in the CTA DATA
working group.

The current status and work in progress concerning the specification of data
model at level 3 (which is the output of the CTA pipeline and the input to the
science tools: event lists, instrument response functions, ...) will be
explained.

## Outline

Just some first ideas for now ... to be confirmed:

* ...
* CTA data management (data levels, models, flow, rates)
* CTA observer access (guest observers, archive, data and science tools)
* Focus: CTA DL3 event list and IRF data model and format specification
* Status, timeline for CTA DATA activities (requirements, specifications, implementations)... how to join? upcoming meetings?
* Maybe: Which parts of CTA software (pipeline and science tools) will be open source? Which license? Python?
* Maybe: A second CTA "data challenge" or "science challenge" in 2016?
* What can we work on this week?
