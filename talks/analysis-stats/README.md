# Talk - Statistics for gamma-ray astronomy

* Presenter: [Michael Schmelling](michael-mpik)
* Duration: 25 + 5 min

## Abstract

This talk will give an overview of statistics for in gamma-ray astronomy,
e.g. how parameters and parameter errors are estimated, or how signal
detections are quantified and reported.

Both theoretical concepts as well as computational methods will be covered, i.e.
you will learn both how statistics are defined as well as how you can compute
them efficiently.

There will be a hands-on tutorial with Python coding excercises later in the week.

## Outline

To be discussed ... this is just a first suggestion:

Given the limited time, the focus will be on the most common statistical
concepts and methods for gamma-ray astronomy.

* Poisson likelihood (cash statistic)
* Nuisance parameters, profile likelihood (wstat statistic)
* Relation of likelihood to Bayesian statistics (prior and posterior)
* Parameter estimation, confidence intervals, coverage
* Detection (TS, Wilk's theorem, Li & Ma significance)
* What's the relation between parameter errors, upper limits and sensitivity?
* Overview frequentist and Bayesian computational methods: optimisation, root finding, sampling

Maybe, if there's time:

* explain how MINUIT (MIGRAD, HESSE, MIGRAD) works in detail
* explain how emcee sampling works in detail
* how to handle systematic errors?
* model selection
* searches, trials
