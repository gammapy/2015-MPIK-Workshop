# Talk - Fermi-LAT data and science tools

* Presenter: [Jeremy Perkins](https://github.com/kialio/)
* Duration: 15 + 5 min

## Abstract

This talk will give an introduction to Fermi-LAT data analysis with a focus on
technical details about the files and data model, i.e. information that's not
necessarily needed for end-users, but is important to know for advanced users or
developers that want to know how it works "under the hood".

## Outline

* Content and format of the various files (event list, IRFs, ScienceTools outputs)
* Science tools analysis chain and how e.g. data selection cuts are communicated between tools
* ScienceTools Python interface
