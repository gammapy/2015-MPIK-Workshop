# Talk - H.E.S.S. data analysis with open source tools

* Presenter: [Johannes King](https://github.com/kingj90)
* Duration: 15 + 5 min

## Abstract

[H.E.S.S.](http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/) is an array of
Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia observing the sky at TeV energies since 2004.

In this talk I will report on the activities in H.E.S.S. to export event lists
and instrument response functions (IRFs) to FITS, and to analyse
them using open source science tools like [Gammapy](https://gammapy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
and [ctools](http://cta.irap.omp.eu/ctools-devel/).

Note that since the H.E.S.S. data and non-published science analysis results are not public, this talk will focus on technical aspects (data formats, codes).

## Outline

* The H.E.S.S. telescopes
* H.E.S.S. internal analysis chains
* The "H.E.S.S. data analysis with open source tools (HOST)" task group
* FITS exporters for H.E.S.S. internal analysis chains
* FITS data distribution within H.E.S.S.
* The "Fermi-LAT" data format for event list and IRFs
* Cross-checks against results obtained with the H.E.S.S.-internal software packages using Gammapy and ctools
* Open source tools in H.E.S.S. publications
* What can we achieve at this workshop for H.E.S.S.?
  (data formats, methods, codes)
