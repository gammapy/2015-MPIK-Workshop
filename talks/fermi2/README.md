# Talk - Fermi-LAT pass 8, event classes, FermiPy

* Presenter: [Matthew Wood](https://github.com/woodmd/)
* Duration: 15 + 5 min

## Abstract

This talk will build on the "Fermi-LAT data and science tools" talk by Jeremy
Perkins and cover pass 8 analyses in detail, with a focus on how the event
classes are implemented in the data files, Fermi Science Tools and how the FermiPy Python package manages the event classes and science tool chain.

The "Fermi-LAT data analysis tutorial" later in the week will give a hands-on
introduction to Fermi Pass 8 analysis.
