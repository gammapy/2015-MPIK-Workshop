# Talk - Exploring large-scale data processing in Python with CTA

* Presenter: [Karl Kosack](https://github.com/kosack)
* Duration: 15 + 5 min

## Abstract

The upcoming CTA (Cherenkov Telescope Array) observatory faces the
challenge of processing a large amount of binary data, similar in
scale to that produced by the LHC at CERN. CTA's predecessors have all
used data processing pipelines heavily based on CERN's ROOT framework
and a mixture of compiled and scripted C++. Pitfalls related to this
approach along with a desire to leverage code development from a wider
scientific and industrial community have led us to explore using modern
Python (with packages like numpy, scikit-learn, astropy, etc) for at
least the high-level parts of the CTA pipeline, and likely extending
to the low-level algorithms. In this presentation I will present the
challenges we face and what solutions we are currently exploring for
interoperability and code optimization.
