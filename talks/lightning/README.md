# Lightning talk session

* Chair: [Luigi Tibaldo](https://github.com/tibaldo)
* Friday, 9:15 -- 11:00

## What is this?

Wikipedia defines [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) like this:

> A lightning talk is a very short presentation lasting only a few minutes,
> given at a conference or similar forum.
> Several lightning talks will usually be delivered by different speakers
> in a single session, sometimes called a data blitz.

In this session, every participant can give a 5-minute talk on
anything loosely
related to the workshop theme (Python, gamma-ray astronomy).

Just as examples, you could talk about or demo a Python package you think
people should know about. Or talk about how you've used Python to implement
some analysis. If you tried any of the codes covered in the workshop
you can demonstrate your user case or bring up issues you encountered. Or maybe there's something you'd like to implement in the
coming weeks / months and you're looking for someone to do it with you?

## Sign up

Please ping  <a href="mailto:luigi.tibaldo@mpi-hd.mpg.de">Luigi

All that's needed beforehand is a title for your lightning talk.
The workshop participants will choose the best lightning talk and the
speaker will receive as prize the book ["Effective Computation in Physics"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033424.do).
